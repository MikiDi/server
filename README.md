===================

This is the OpenWanderer server, now available as a Composer package `openwanderr/openwanderer`.

Licensing
---------

As of the first commit on October 10, 2020, the code is now licensed under the Lesser GNU General Public License, by agreement between both OpenWanderer repository owners (@mrAceT and @nickw). The exception is third-party code such as `geojson-path-finder` which is licensed separately, details in the relevant directories. This has been done to:

- ensure that any changes to OpenWanderer itself will remain Free and open source (if you change OpenWanderer, you must make the modified code available under a compatible free software license); 
- but also allow proprietary applications to *use* OpenWanderer code.

Any further changes to the current OpenTrailView - OTV360; repo [here](https://gitlab.com/nickw1/opentrailview) will remain under the GPL v3.

Please see [here](https://github.com/openwanderer/example-app) for an example app built using the OpenWanderer server.
